# Collatz

This is a program in respect of the famous collatz conjecture
It says that: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
This program in Jupyter confirms that, also calculating the number of steps to reach 1.
thanks!
